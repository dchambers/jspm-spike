# jspm-spike

This spike is a little tricky to set-up on your own machine because JSPM doesn't support the `file:` prefix, and you must instead using the `jspm link` and `jspm install --link` commands to allow NPM modules to be developed locally, as we have done here. Please talk to me if you need more info.
